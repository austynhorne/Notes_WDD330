  <P>
    <strong>Web Token(JWT)</strong>is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way 
    for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.<br>
    It is breaked up into three main parts the <strong>Header</strong>, the <strong>Payload</strong>, and the
     <strong>signature</strong>.<br>
     The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm<br>
     The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata.<br>
     The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasâ€™t changed in the way.<br>
     I tried coming up with a way to demonstrate how to use these, but I couldn't.<br>
     I did find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM&t=607s">youtube video</a> that I found very helpful with understanding JWTs
